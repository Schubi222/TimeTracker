# TimeTracker

This projects purpose is to finally replace my excel file I use to track my challenges.

Maybe I will later on turn it to a bigger application with multiple users. But first it will just be for my own usage.

Technologies used: Vue, Pinia, TS, SCSS - if it gets turned into a larger application I will use firebase for Auth and as a DB
